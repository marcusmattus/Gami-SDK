Technical Description for Building Gami Protocol SDK and Application

Step 1: SDK Development

Requirements:
	•	Frontend: React.js, Typescript
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express, GraphQL
	•	Integration: Webhooks, APIs, real-time event handling

Actions:
	•	Develop lightweight React SDK modules for embedding in client platforms.
	•	Implement XP tracking via event listeners triggered by predefined user actions.
	•	Establish secure API endpoints to transmit event data to backend systems.

Step 2: Backend Infrastructure

Requirements:
	•	Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for flexible document storage
	•	API Layer: GraphQL and REST APIs for scalable and flexible integration
	•	Security: JWT, OAuth, cryptographic signing of transactions

Actions:
	•	Setup databases for tracking users, XP events, and transaction histories.
	•	Develop API services for receiving, validating, and processing XP event data.
	•	Implement secure data handling and access management.

Step 3: Reward Mechanism

Requirements:
	•	Blockchain: Initially Solana Layer 1 (Rust-based smart contracts)
	•	Cross-Chain Integration: Wormhole protocol for bridging
	•	Token Management: Use of $GAMI tokens from private sale distribution

Actions:
	•	Design smart contracts to mint and manage token rewards based on user XP accrual.
	•	Integrate Wormhole for future cross-chain token and NFT transfers.
	•	Ensure compatibility of token mechanisms with private sale tokens, maintaining tokenomics consistency.

Step 4: Centralized User App

Requirements:
	•	Frontend: React Native for mobile, React.js for web
	•	Wallet Integration: Phantom, Solflare, WalletConnect
	•	Identity & Authentication: Hybrid (Email/Web3 Wallet Authentication)

Actions:
	•	Build a centralized app to aggregate XP and rewards from integrated platforms.
	•	Develop interfaces for users to claim, redeem, stake, and manage rewards.
	•	Implement secure wallet integration to handle user-owned tokens and NFTs.

Step 5: Admin Dashboard Development

Requirements:
	•	Frontend: React.js, Ant Design or similar UI frameworks
	•	Backend Integration: APIs to interact with SDK and user databases
	•	Analytics: Real-time dashboards and reporting functionalities

Actions:
	•	Create a no-code interface for businesses to manage gamification campaigns.
	•	Implement analytics dashboards showing real-time user engagement, reward distribution, and XP tracking.

Step 6: Layer 2 Scalability (Future Phase)

Requirements:
	•	Layer 2 Solution: Custom SVM-based rollup or established solution
	•	Infrastructure: High throughput, low-latency blockchain environment
	•	Integration: Seamless bridging from existing Layer 1 implementations

Actions:
	•	Architect Layer 2 solution to manage high volumes of XP and reward transactions efficiently.
	•	Integrate rollup or similar scaling technology to lower transaction costs and increase throughput.
	•	Migrate existing smart contracts and systems to Layer 2, ensuring minimal disruption.

Step 7: Token Sale Integration and Tokenomics

Requirements:
	•	Token Distribution: Align with private sale allocations
	•	Token Utility: Clearly defined economic incentives for users and businesses

Actions:
	•	Develop token management modules within smart contracts and backend systems.
	•	Ensure tokens distributed in the private sale are compatible and integrated into the reward and staking mechanisms.
	•	Continuously manage tokenomics to align incentives for long-term ecosystem health.

Technical Stack Summary
	•	Frontend: React.js, React Native, Typescript
	•	Backend: Node.js, GraphQL, Express
	•	Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
	•	Blockchain: Solana (Rust), future SVM Layer 2
	•	Wallets & Identity: Phantom, Solflare, WalletConnect, JWT, OAuth
	•	Security: Cryptographic signing, audited smart contracts

By following this structured technical framework, Gami Protocol can efficiently build, deploy, and scale its SDK, application, and robust reward mechanism, accommodating future growth and blockchain advancements.
